This project explores the relationships between student performance variables using correlation and regression analysis in R.

Part 1 examines correlations among five variables: attendance, project scores, test scores, participation, and hours studied. A correlation heatmap was generated to visualize the strength and direction of relationships. The analysis found that hours studied and test scores and participation and project scores had the strongest positive correlations, while attendance showed little correlation with other variables, suggesting it may have minimal impact on academic performance compared to other factors.

Part 2 performs regression analysis to predict test scores and project scores using hours studied, attendance, and participation as predictor variables. Results indicate that hours studied is the most influential predictor of test scores, while participation strongly predicts project scores. Regression analysis differs from correlation in that it models how predictor variables influence an outcome variable rather than just showing relationships between pairs of variables.

This project demonstrates the application of correlation matrices, heatmaps, linear regression models, and interpretation of R outputs for understanding variable relationships in educational data.
