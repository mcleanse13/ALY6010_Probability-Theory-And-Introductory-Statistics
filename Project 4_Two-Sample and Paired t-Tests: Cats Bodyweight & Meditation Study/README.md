This project focuses on hypothesis testing using t-tests in R to analyze two datasets.

Part 1 examines the bodyweights of male and female cats using the cats dataset from the MASS package. A two-sample t-test, including Welchâ€™s test and a one-sided t-test, was performed to determine if male cats have a higher average bodyweight than female cats. The results, supported by boxplots and summary statistics, indicate a statistically significant difference in bodyweight, with males generally larger and showing a wider range of weights.

Part 2 investigates whether a meditation workshop improves sleep quality in a sample of 10 students. A paired t-test was conducted comparing sleep quality scores before and after the workshop. Although the average score increased slightly, the t-test results and p-values suggest there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating the workshop did not significantly improve sleep quality.

This project demonstrates practical application of independent and paired t-tests, interpretation of p-values, and visualization of statistical results using R.
