ALY 6010 Final Project – Exploratory and Inferential Data Analysis

This project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and regression modeling to investigate relationships within a large dataset (6,000+ records). The goal of this analysis was to identify meaningful patterns, evaluate hypotheses, and uncover relationships between key variables through both descriptive and inferential statistics.

The project was completed in three phases:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examined the structure and characteristics of the dataset, cleaned missing or incorrect values, and created visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to summarize the data and detect patterns.

Hypothesis Testing: Formulated and tested multiple hypotheses using one-sample and two-sample tests to draw inferences about population parameters based on sample data.

Regression Analysis: Applied correlation and linear regression techniques to explore relationships between variables, identify trends, and quantify the strength of associations.

Deliverables include a comprehensive analytical report, a presentation summarizing results for a managerial audience, and the R scripts used to perform all analyses. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation using R and aligns with the course’s learning outcomes in statistical reasoning and data-driven decision-making.
