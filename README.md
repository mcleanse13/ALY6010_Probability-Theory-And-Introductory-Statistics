ALY 6010: Probability and Statistics for Business Analytics

This course introduces fundamental statistical concepts and methods used in business analytics from an applied, data-driven perspective. Topics include frequency distributions, measures of central tendency and dispersion, probability, sampling, regression, correlation, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). I also gained a hands-on experience using statistical software such as R and Excel to conduct data analysis, perform hypothesis testing, and interpret results.

Through a combination of labs and projects, the course builds the mathematical and analytical foundation necessary for advanced analytics coursework. By the end of the course, we were able to formulate strategic and operational questions, apply statistical techniques to answer them, and translate analytical findings into meaningful business insights.
