This project investigates car seller behavior in 2022 by examining relationships between car selling price, year of the vehicle, and seller type using regression analysis in R.

Part 1 explores the impact of seller type on the relationship between car selling price (dependent variable) and year of the car (independent variable) by creating dummy variables. Three subsets were created—individual sellers, dealers, and trust mark dealers—each with a regression line. Multiple regression lines in a single scatterplot highlighted patterns across seller types, showing that selling prices tend to increase with newer cars for all seller types.

Part 2 analyzes each subset individually. Separate scatterplots for each seller type allowed for a clearer view of trends and outliers. Findings revealed that individual sellers often sell newer cars at higher prices, dealers sell a mix of newer and older cars with more outliers, and trust mark dealers show weaker relationships due to a smaller dataset.

Overall, using dummy variables and subset regression analysis provides deeper insights into categorical impacts on car selling behaviors. This approach helps visualize patterns, identify differences between seller types, and understand how regression relationships vary across categories.
