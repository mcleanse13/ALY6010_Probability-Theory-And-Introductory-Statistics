This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental health using a Kaggle dataset containing 736 survey responses and 33 variables related to music preferences, listening patterns, and self-reported mental health symptoms. The goal of this analysis was to determine whether certain genres, listening durations, or contexts (such as listening at work) were associated with improved mental health outcomes.

The dataset was imported and cleaned in R, with unnecessary variables removed to focus on key factors such as music genre, hours of listening per day, streaming platform, listening context, and mental health effects. The analysis was narrowed to Spotify users who listen to at least three hours of music per day to better capture individuals with strong engagement in music listening.

Using frequency tables, cross-tabulations, and visualizations (including histograms and bar charts), the analysis revealed several trends:

Individuals listening to 4–5 hours of music daily were most likely to report mental health improvement.

Those who listened to music at work showed the highest rates of mental health benefit.

Across all genres—rock, pop, hip-hop, R&B, and country—music generally correlated with positive mental health outcomes, though respondents who rarely listened to a genre were less likely to see improvement.

This project demonstrates foundational data cleaning, categorical analysis, and visualization skills in R, with a focus on drawing insights from real-world behavioral data.
