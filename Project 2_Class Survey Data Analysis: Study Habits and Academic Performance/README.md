Academic Performance and Behavioral Factors: An R-Based Analysis of Student Survey Data

This project analyzes a survey dataset of 1,000 students to explore relationships between academic performance (GPA) and various demographic and behavioral factors, including age, gender, major, and study hours. The dataset was designed to test whether these categories influence students’ grade point averages and to identify any meaningful trends across subgroups.

Using R, the dataset was cleaned, summarized, and analyzed through descriptive statistics tables (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and count) and a range of visualizations, including scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots, and jitter plots. Each visualization was paired with interpretive analysis to highlight insights and detect outliers.

Key findings include:

- Study Hours vs. GPA: The average GPA centers around 3.0, with roughly 20 study hours per week, but the best-fit line suggests a slight decline in GPA as study hours increase. It is an unexpected trend that may indicate study efficiency rather than volume as the true differentiator.

- Age and Study Patterns: Younger students demonstrated more consistent study habits than older, non-traditional students, suggesting stability in academic routines among traditional college-aged learners.

- Gender Comparison: Female students had higher and more consistent GPAs than males, despite reporting slightly fewer study hours.

- Major and GPA: Across the four majors (Arts, Sciences, Commerce, Engineering), GPA remained relatively uniform, indicating that field of study did not significantly affect performance.

Overall, this analysis reinforces that academic success is multifactorial—study time alone does not determine performance, and additional factors such as learning methods and motivation warrant further exploration. The project demonstrates practical application of R-based descriptive analytics, data visualization, and interpretive reporting techniques.
